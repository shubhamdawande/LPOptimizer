### Issues

1) After including budget constraint, only economy class items are selected:
Reason - possibly better value function required 
solution - solves the issue after simplifying the value function

2) After including budget constraint, for any class, low priced items are selected. Value function is fine.
-> Reason: Optimizer tries to maximize not just objective function but also the price - budget gap.
-> Consider 2 scenarios:
total price low, value 100
total price high but under budget, value 100 (same) 
optimizer selects scenario 1 
This happens since value depends only on Asset class not price
->To be fixed
-> Solution: value function modelling as per price point

3) mutually exclusive relationship: E,P,L
Solution 1 - E+P+L <= max(E,P,L)
